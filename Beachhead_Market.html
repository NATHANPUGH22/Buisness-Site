                <h3>What group of people would benefit the most from my product/service?</h3>
                <p>As I said before, the group of people this is geared to and I believe this would benefit the most are hobbyists and DIY enthusiasts as they can bring their creative ideas to life without investing in their own 3D printers.</p>

                <h3>Where do they spend their time (online or in person)?</h3>
                <p>My target audience might spend their time in places like Reddit on channels such as r/3Dprinting & r/DIY. They might also spend their time on YouTube (for tutorials), Facebook groups, and forums like Thingiverse or Printables for ideas.</p>
